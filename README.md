# Football-Data-Analysis
The objective of the project is to build a website which will showcase the predictions of upcoming football matches of the EPL League. The goal is to create a visual understanding of the performance history of all the teams that have ever competed in the EPL throughout the years. 


There are two parts of this project:

Data Scraping , preprocessing and analyzing : Involves the process of fine-tuning and cleaning the scraped data and creating multiple datasets out of the raw data. This project made no use of any pre-existing dataset but has relied on the subsetted data for future prediction models and analysis.


Visualization website with statistics : involves creation of a website which is made to be interactive for the user to be able to select all parameters that affect the Full Time Result (win, lose or draw) of a match and to be able to visually understand it and draw inferences.
